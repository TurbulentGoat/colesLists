## Getting Started

To get started with the Coles Lists Userscript:

1. **Install a Userscript Manager:**
   
   If you don't have a userscript manager, get one. The choices are:

   - **Tampermonkey:**
     - [Google Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo)
     - [Mozilla Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/tampermonkey/)
     - [Microsoft Edge](https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo)
     - [Safari](https://www.tampermonkey.net/download.php?browser=safari)
   
   - **GreaseMonkey:**
     - [Mozilla Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/)

2. **Install the Userscript:**

   - Go to the [Coles Lists Userscript Raw File](https://github.com/TurbulentGoat/colesLists/coles-lists.user.js).
   - Click on the **"Raw"** button to view the raw script.
   - Your userscript manager should prompt you to install the script. Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation.

3. **Use the Userscript:**

   - Navigate to your Coles shopping lists on the website.
   - Click the **Export Shopping Lists** button that appears.
   - View, print, or email your exported shopping lists from the new tab.

   **Note:** If you don't see the export button on any of the `/lists` pages, ensure that the userscript is properly installed and that you're on the correct page.

   I have noticed that Coles may change the structure of their website periodically, which might cause the userscript to stop working without prior warning.

## Possible Future Enhancements

- **Price Alerts:** Notify users when prices of items in their lists drop below a certain threshold.
- **Multi-Store Support:** Extend functionality to support shopping lists from other stores.
- **Advanced Filtering:** Allow users to filter items based on categories, brands, or price ranges.
- **Dark Mode Support:** Provide a dark mode option for the exported lists for better readability in low-light environments.
